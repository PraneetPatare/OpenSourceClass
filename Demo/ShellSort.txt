Shell Sort:
Shell sort is an algorithm that first sorts the elements far apart froom each other and successfully reduces the interval between the elements to be sorted.
It is generalised version of insertion sort.

Algorithm for Shell Sort:
1.Start
2.Initialize mid as half of length of array.
3.Set i equal to mid.
4.Initialize temp as array[i]
5.Set j equal to i
6.Shift array[j-mid] to array[j]
7.Decrement j by mid
8.Repeat steps 6 and 7 while j>=mid and array[j-mid]>temp
9.Set array[j] equal to temp.
10.Increment value of I by 1.
11.Repeat steps 4 to 10 while i<n
12.Set mid equal to mid/2
13.Repeat steps 2 to 12 while mid is greater than 0.
14.Return array
15.Stop.
